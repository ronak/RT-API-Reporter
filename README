Description:
    I created this to tool to retrieve the Rotten Tomatoes
    browser extensions API usage in my email. It currently 
    only retrieves data for the first API key registered. 
    I run this on a schedule on my server.

Prerequisite Python package(s):
    mechanize

Parameters:
    user_name = ''
    password = ''
    report_days = 5
    mail_server = 'localhost'
    mail_to = ''
    mail_from = ''
    mail_subject = 'RR API Report'

    The path to python at the top of the script is also 
    something that potentially needs to be changed based 
    on your server configuration.
